# MNSeg
MNSeg: Mamba-based 3D Neuron Segmentation Integrated with Bidirectional Attention Mechanism and Topological Loss.

- We propose the first Mamba-based deep network for 3D neuron segmentation.
- We introduce bidirectional attention and clDice loss to enhance the
neuron segmentation.
- Experiments demonstrate superior neuron segmentation and reconstruction performance.
